Geography
=========

LibrariesWest is made up of 7 library services: Bath and North East Somerset, Bristol, Dorset, North Somerset, Somerset, South Gloucestershire, and Poole. These are all neighbouring local authorities, creating an overall area that spans across much of the South West of England.

Geography is very important to our data reporting processes, and data analysis. Library members for example may live mainly within the boundaries of the library service they are registered with, but we also see significant crossover of usage. At LibrariesWest if you have a library card you have access to items in all libraries in those 7 local authorities. People can pick up items from any library, and return them to any other library. We also have many members who visit from outside of any of those authorities - particularly in neighbouring services outside of LibrariesWest.

It is important then that we have data on these authority boundaries to be able to match members to different areas. But it is also important to use other geographical boundaries, such as [census based geography](https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/geography/ukgeographies/censusgeography) (super output areas). These are smaller areas that have census (and other) statistical information assigned to them, such as the Index of Multiple Deprivation, an indicator of the relative deprivation within an area. Reporting on our membership in this way means we can make some better estimations about the reach of the library services, and which areas are particularly being served.

It is difficult to make firm conclusions from this data, especially as library membership is only a subset of the population in any area, but these geography files provide supporting information for some of the geographic references within our open data.

#### Open data

The data listed in the Geography section of our open data does not belong to LibrariesWest, we have extracted open data from Ordnance Survey (OS), and from the Office for National Statistics to have these specifically for the LibrariesWest area. In the documentation for each section we will list the licence terms, and provide links to the full datasets.
