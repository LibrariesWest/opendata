Historic precipitation data is available through the Met Office Hadley Centre observations datasets: HadUKP.

HadUKP is a series of datasets of UK regional precipitation, which incorporates the long-running England & Wales Precipitation (EWP) series beginning in 1766, the longest instrumental series of this kind in the world.

The data is available on a regional basis so we have taken a copy of the South West daily totals data. These provide a daily precipitation value since 1931. This data is provided as a text file with a row for each month, values separated by spaces. A python script in this repository converts the data into a CSV file.
