Open Data
=========

This is the repository for LibrariesWest Open Data.

Why open data?
--------------

In local government there are requirements for certain datasets to be made open, as a minimum. These are laid out as part of the [Local Government Transparency Code 2015](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/local-government-transparency-code-2015).

The code goes further than specific datasets, and also states:

> the Government believes that in principle all data held and managed by local authorities should be made available to local people unless there are specific sensitivities (eg. protecting vulnerable people or commercial and operational considerations) to doing so. It encourages local authorities to see data as a valuable resource not only to themselves, but also their partners and local people.

LibrariesWest open data
-----------------------

LibrariesWest manage data for 7 authorities primarily around the Library Management System (LMS).  This covers library borrowing, members, reservations, and the library catalogue.

Our open data is split into folders by category.  Each category of data will have separate documentation for those datasets.

Not all of this data is released by LibrariesWest.  We will also be including relevant open data from other sources, such as Ordnance Survey data and Office for National Statistics data where this relates to the LibrariesWest area.

Categories of Data
------------------

| Category | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Bills | Data relating to bills generated in the system (e.g. charges for items, payments taken for printing) |
| Geography | Some open geography data covering the area of LibrariesWest.  Primarily taken from Ordnance Survey Open Data |
| Movement | Movement of stock around the authority |
| Membership | Our members, demographics, areas of usage, and deprivation indicators  |
