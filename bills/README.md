Bills
-----

Bill data holds the data on bills that have been incurred by patrons.

For example, User A places a reservation (known as a 'hold') on an item, which incurs a bill of Â£1. In the system, that creates a bill record that will look a bit like the following:

| User ID | Bill number | Bill reason | Bill library | Bill amount |
| ------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| 12345 | 1 | HOLD | Bath Central | 1 |


Bill payments
-------------

Bill payment data holds the data on payments that have been made by patrons to pay bills.
