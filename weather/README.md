Weather
=======

Does weather have any effect on library usage? LibrariesWest don't hold data like footfall, this is held by individual library services. So it's not possible from this data to see trends such as people coming into the library more on a rainy day, or perhaps staying for longer. We do have data on the number of reservations placed each day (including whether that's done in the library, or online), and the number of issues of items from libraries each day (see our [usage data](./../usage/README.md))

It's worth collecting some historic climate data, so if anyone does want to attempt any analysis of library usage, and how that may be affected by the weather, they can do so.
