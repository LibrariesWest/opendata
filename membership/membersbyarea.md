- [Download member summary data](./members_summary.csv)

| Registered library | The library the users are registered with | Bath Central |
| Users | The number of users | 100 |

#### Detail

Further detail breaks down the membership counts into statistical areas that represent where the members are based. These use areas such as county, district, and super output areas. For more info on these see our [geography data](./../geography/README.md)

Because this data is reported at fairly low levels we suppress reporting of numbers less than 5, by using a *. This should be taken into account when using the data and trying to sum the values of members in each area. For more accurate total numbers you would be better off using the summary data which is correct to the nearest 10 people.
