Payments
=============

We export two payment data files. A summary for basic data counts, and a full detail file.

#### Summary file

The summary includes the number of payment records recorded in the Library Management System, separated by Library authority, the bill reason, and financial year of payment. This will cover the previous financial year, and the current.
