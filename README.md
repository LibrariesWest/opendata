LibrariesWest manage data for 7 local authority library services, primarily stored in the Library Management System (LMS). This covers library borrowing, members, reservations, movement of stock, and the library catalogue.

Our open data is split into folders by category. Each category of data will have separate documentation for those datasets.

We will also be including open data from other sources, such as Ordnance Survey data and Office for National Statistics data, where these relate to the LibrariesWest area.

#### Open data

Open data is data that anyone can access, share, and make use of. [The Open Data Institute provides more information about open data and its potential on their web site](https://theodi.org/what-is-open-data).

In local government there are requirements for certain datasets to be published. These are listed in the [Local Government Transparency Code 2015](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/local-government-transparency-code-2015). The code goes further, and states:

> the Government believes that in principle all data held and managed by local authorities should be made available to local people unless there are specific sensitivities (eg. protecting vulnerable people or commercial and operational considerations) to doing so. It encourages local authorities to see data as a valuable resource not only to themselves, but also their partners and local people.

As part of our commitment to open data, we have made several datasets available from our Library Management System (LMS). They include data on library membership, movement of stock, the catalogue, as well as other aspects of library use and operations. The datasets are anonymised, and freely available for anyone to download and use. 

#### Licence

Data is released under the [Open Government Licence](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/).

Though we attempt to ensure all data is correct and accurate, you may find there are errors, or quirks to the data. If you notice anything then please don't hesitate to [contact us](https://lwc.ent.sirsidynix.net.uk/client/en_GB/default/?rm=CONTACT+US1%7C%7C%7C1%7C%7C%7C0%7C%7C%7Ctrue).
