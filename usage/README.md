Usage
=====

In the grand scheme of library usage we don't actually hold that much data. People browsing around, visiting, reading newspapers, working on laptops, working on public access PCs, asking questions, going to events. There will be data for many of these things but much of it will be held by the individual library services.

LibrariesWest manage the Library Management System so that concerns data about usage of the catalogue. People reserving items, taking out items, and renewing them.

When placing a reservation, the reservation is normally placed against the Title rather then the Item (see our [catalogue data](./../catalogue/README.md) for difference between titles and items). For example, there may be 10 copies of 'Voyage of the Dawn Treader', around LibrariesWest, and the system will need to dynamically decide which one of those copies to assign to the reservation. This will be influenced by things such as which library the user wants to pick up the item from, whcih copies are available, whether the item can be sourced and transferred within a single library service, and other factors.

Regardless of that when a reservation is placed a record is created.
