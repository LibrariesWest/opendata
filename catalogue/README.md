Our catalogue
=============

Catalogue data is made up of items and titles. A title record describes an item of work, and has fields like Title, Author, ISBN, etc. See below for an example.

| Catalogue key | Title | Author | ISBN | Published Year | Created |

| i9780261670501 | The voyage of the Dawn Treader | Lewis, C. S. | 0261670506 | 2002 | 2006-07-15 |

An item is an instance of a title, such as a particular copy of a book. It will have associated data such as number of issues, library held at, and price.

#### Open data extracts

Our open data extracts will include all catalogue titles available in our public libraries, as long as we hold at least one item for that title, and all items. This should match the data available to search on the Libraries West catalogue site.
