Titles
======

Title data is exported as a single file for the whole of LibrariesWest catalogue. Catalogue title records are shared between authorities so library services will hold items under a catalogue record that is also used for another service's items.

We do not provide summary information for the title data as there are few obvious ways of aggregating this data. We could try aggregating by author for example, but authors are stored in a variety of ways across different titles, so this wouldn't be accurate. Similarly aggregating by date created could be possible, but this doesn't necessarily reflect the number of items that are created each year, just the number of title records. So isn't too meaningful.

Therefore the single export is the full list of titles in the Library Management System.
