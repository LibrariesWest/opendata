Titles
======

Title data is exported as a single file for the whole of LibrariesWest catalogue. Title records are shared between library services, so one service may own items that are catalaogued under a record also used for another service's items.

We do not provide a summary file for the title data as there are few obvious ways of aggregating this data. We could try grouping and counting by author for example, but authors are stored in a variety of ways across different titles. Aggregating by date created could be possible, but doesn't necessarily reflect the number of items created each year, just the number of title records. So isn't too meaningful.

Therefore the single export is the full list of titles in the Library Management System.
